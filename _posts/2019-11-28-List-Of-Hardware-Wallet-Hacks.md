### September

Vendor: Trezor

Patch: https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/commit/2bbbc3e15573294c6dd0273d2a8542ba42507eb0  
Explanation from vendor: https://blog.trezor.io/details-about-the-security-updates-in-trezor-one-firmware-1-7-1-5c34278425d8  

Vendor: Trezor  
Title: Side-channel analysis (SCA) of PIN comparison  
Detail: Using a SCA bench an attacker could create the database of power consumption and electromagnetic traces of a device. This database could later be used to unlock a locked device using the same SCA bench. The issue was fixed by rewriting the device storage to not compare PINs directly, but rather compare random data stretched by the PIN.  
Type: Information leak  
Bug: Naive implementation of PIN storage  
Reporter: Charles Guillemet  
Patch: https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/commit/4f32cb508383ec0e65843d037f6ac6473a668359  

### November

Vendor: Trezor  
Title: Information leak via U2F  
Detail: The C/C++ reference implementation for U2F by Yubico contains broken definition of a struct which can leak bytes from RAM via USB. The bug was fixed by updating the structure definition to a new correct one.  
Type: Information leak  
Bug: Bad struct memory layout

Vendor: Ledger  
Title: Bitcoin change address injection  
Detail: A vulnerability was found in the Bitcoin app allowing an attacker to add an unverified output change address into a legit transaction. It can lead to sending funds to an arbitrary address without requiring an additional confirmation on the device. The original transaction still has to be confirmed though.  
Bug: Bad Bitcoin transcation information validation

# 2019
### January

Vendor: Trezor  
Title: Secret information leak via USB Descriptors  
Detail: The attack used specialized hardware to inject a fault into the comparison function in the USB stack. When timed properly, an attacker could trick USB stack into returning sensitive data via USB in the USB descriptor.  
Type: Information leak  
Bug: Outgoing packets too big, MPU did not protect sectors around the actual storage sectors, which would have halted execution        
Reporter: Colin O'Flynn  
Patch: https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/commit/22f37e81a3270da5e8e5d6c55abc8f15f3a35567

### April

Vendor: Trezor  
Title: Information leak via OLED display  
Detail: The attack uses power analysis to read the information shown on the OLED display.  
Type: Information leak  
Bug: OLED screens consume power based on number of pixels that are on. Mitigated here by making the number of pixels that are on per row when displaying the seed constant  
Reporter: Christian Reiter  
Patch: https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/commit/f16c941ed4ac3c2e2c401de931249d0b2f34c29b  
Explanation from vendor: https://blog.trezor.io/details-of-the-oled-vulnerability-and-its-mitigation-d331c4e2001a  
Explanation from reporter: https://blog.inhq.net/posts/oled-side-channel-status-summary/  

Vendor: Ledger  
Title: OLED screen side-channel vulnerability.  
Detail: A side-channel leakage on the row-based OLED display was found. The power consumption of each row-based display cycle depends on the number of illuminated pixels, allowing a partial recovery of display contents. For example, a hardware implant in the USB cable might be able to leverage this behavior to recover confidential secrets such as the PIN and BIP39 mnemonic. In other words, the side-channel is relevant only if the attacker has enough control over the deviceâ€™s USB connection to make power-consumption measurements and advanced statistical analysis while the secret data is displayed. The side-channel is not relevant in other circumstances, such as a stolen device that is not currently displaying secret data.  
Type: Information leak  
Bug: OLED screens consume power based on number of pixels that are on. Mitigated here by making the number of pixels that are on per row when displaying the seed constant

### October

Vendor: Trezor  
Title: Malicious change in a mixed transaction  
Detail: An attacker could create a specially crafted multisig transaction which would hide the multisig change address.  
Type: Missing Check  
Bug: Input and output Bitcoin transaction fingerprints were not sufficiently checked.  
Reporter: Marko Bencun  
Patch: https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/commit/8eb6ce08995514c67d175b7197feeadeccc48ff0  
Explanation from vendor: https://blog.trezor.io/details-of-the-multisig-change-address-issue-and-its-mitigation-6370ad73ed2a  
Explanation from reporter: https://medium.com/shiftcrypto/a-remote-theft-attack-on-trezor-model-t-44127cd7fb5a  

Vendor: Ledger  
Title: Monero private key retrieval.  
Detail: The Monero App for Ledger Nano was found to be vulnerable to a private key retrieval through the use of a malicious Monero Client (desktop application). Some computational elements are encrypted by the Nano S with a key only known to the Monero application, and sent to the desktop client for later use, due to space limitations on the Nano. During the final step of the signature (MLSAG sign), the client sends back some sensitive encrypted elements which the app uses to compute a Schnorr signature. A malicious client can misuse this by replaying earlier elements of this computation, and induce a variant of a nonce-reuse attack (see for example the PS3 Fail). This replay of commands is possible because the key derived by the app to encrypt elements is static, and there is no message authentication.  
Bug: Bad MLSA signature implementation   
Patch: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-monero/commit/5d0658ad6369f3d0ff2d10ee9effa410eb185b98
