While my life centers around the acquisition of ice cream, I work part time at
[shiftcrypto](https://shiftcrypto.ch), study undergrad physics and computer science at the university of Zurich,
and dabble my hands in build systems and cryptocurrencies. I am a huge fan and proponent
of [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) and the
[guix linux distribution](http://guix.gnu.org/).
