My life centers around the acquisition of ice cream, but next to that I study
undergrad physics and computer science at the university of Zurich, and dabble
my hands in build systems and cryptocurrencies. I am a huge fan and proponent
of [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org) and the [guix linux
distribution](http://guix.gnu.org/). I care about privacy, ecology and
democracy.
